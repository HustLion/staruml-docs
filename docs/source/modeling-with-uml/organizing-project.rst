==================
Organizing Project
==================

A system is typically described in multiple perspectives. You can start a modeling project by selecting a template. To start a project with a template, select **File | New From Template | <TemplateName>**. StarUML supports 4 default templates:

* **UMLMinimal** - A single model with UML Standard Profile.
* **UMLConventional** - Use Case Model, Analysis Model, Design Model, Implementation Model, and Deployment Model with UML Standard Profile.
* **4+1 View Model** - Pilippe Kruchten's `4+1 Architectural View Model <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%2B1_architectural_view_model>`_.
* **Rational** : Approach of Rational Rose Tool.

If you don't want to use pre-defined templates, you need to make your own project structure.

Modeling with UML
=================


Organizing Project
==================

A system is typically described in multiple perspectives. You can start a modeling project by selecting a template. To start a project with a template, select **File | New From Template | <TemplateName>**. StarUML supports 4 default templates:

* UMLMinimal : A single model with UML Standard Profile.
* UMLConventional : Use Case Model, Analysis Model, Design Model, Implementation Model, and Deployment Model with UML Standard Profile.
* 4+1 View Model : Pilippe Kruchten's `4+1 Architectural View Model <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%2B1_architectural_view_model>`_.
* Rational : Approach of Rational Rose Tool.

If you don't want to use pre-defined templates, you need to make your own project structure.

Project
=======

*Project* is a top-level namespace stored as a single file.

Modeling a software system requires describing multiple models because it is not enough to describe the system with a single perspective, so we typically make multiple models such as *Use-Case Model*, *Design Model*, *Component Model*, *Deployment Model*, or others in a *Project*.

Typically *Project* is organized as a set of *UMLModels*, *UMLPackages*, or *UMLSubsystems*. If you want to know more about UML Elements, please refer to OMG UML Specification.

Model Element, View Element, and Diagram
========================================

*Element* is building block constitutes a software model. There are three kinds of *Elements*: *Model Element*, *View Element*, and *Diagram*.

You need to have a clear conceptual distinction between Model Elements, View Elements and Diagrams. A *Model Element* is an element that contains information for a software model. A *View Element* is a visual representation of a particular a *Model Element*. a *Diagram* is a collection of *View Elements* in order to represent a partcular perspective of the system.

Introduction
============

This chapter contains a general overview of StarUML™. Included are brief overviews of StarUML™ and UML, and outlines of StarUML™’s new features and overall organization.

What is StarUML
===============

StarUML™ is a software modeling platform that supports UML (Unified Modeling Language). It is based on UML version 1.4 and provides eleven different types of diagram, and it accepts UML 2.0 notation. It actively supports the MDA (Model Driven Architecture) approach by supporting the UML profile concept. StarUML™ excels in customizability to the user’s environment and has a high extensibility in its functionality. Using StarUML™, one of the top leading software modeling tools, will guarantee to maximize the productivity and quality of your software projects.

UML Tool that Adapts to the User
--------------------------------

StarUML™ provides maximum customization to the user’s environment by offering customizing variables that can be applied in the user’s software development methodology, project platform, and language.

True MDA Support
----------------

Software architecture is a critical process that can reach 10 years or more into the future. The intention of the OMG (Object Management Group) is to use MDA (Model Driven Architecture) technology to create platform independent models and allow automatic acquisition of platform dependent models or codes from platform independent models. StarUML™ truly complies with UML 1.4 standards, UML 2.0 notation and provides the UML Profile concept, allowing creation of platform independent models. Users can easily obtain their end products through simple template document.

Excellent Extensibility and Flexibility
---------------------------------------

StarUML™ provides excellent extensibility and flexibility. It provides Add-In frameworks for extending the functionality of the tool. It is designed to allow access to all functions of the model/meta-model and tool through COM Automation, and it provides extension of menu and option items. Also, users can create their own approaches and frameworks according to their methodologies. The tool can also be integrated with any external tools.
